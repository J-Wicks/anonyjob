Dear New York City Office of Emergency Management
Attached please find a copy of my resume. I am currently a junior at John Jay College of Criminal justice. I am extremely interested in working as an intern.
You will see from my resume that I don’t have a lot of experience in the emergency management field. However, I believe that what I lack in experience I make up for in my motivation to continue learning in this field. I believe this opportunity would be perfect fit for me while I continue my education studying emergency management at John Jay. I am confident in my ability to learn and adapt to a new position.
I look forward to speaking with you and learning more about New York City’s Office of Emergency Management. Please contact me to discuss the intern position in more detail. I appreciate your consideration and hope to hear from you soon.
