I understand that many of you voted for Trump because you wanted to see someone go to Washington and shake things up. You wanted to see someone take an axe to Big Government. Well, as they say, careful for what you wish for. And please be careful to watch where the chopped-down trees fall. I’m not here to gloat and wave my finger and say, “I told you that man’s a greedy asshole, a goblin shark in a suit, and he doesn’t care about you.” Why say that now? No one profits from that. But how you can defend snatching food from the mouths of homebound seniors? Or deny life-saving healthcare to cancer patients? All so that we can increase our military budget. US military spending is already more than the combined annual military budgets of China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, United Kingdom, India, France and Japan.
