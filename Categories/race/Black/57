I assume you know that deuterium is a naturally-occurring isotope in water at roughly 1/3200 parts of H20. I’m not claiming anything spiritual. I’m about as skeptical as one can be. Think you may be leaping to a conclusion that I’m advocating something I’m not. Consider it this way, I reported that electrolysis is a means to produce/separate pre-existing deuterium from “light” water. Which is possible. It would require gallons and gallons of water to separate out a liter of deuterium, and one could continue to process it with electrolysis to separate out more and more heavy water (deuterium). Think you may be looking for a fight where there is none. I’m not looking to overturn science, only to ask questions worth considering. And I have to ask: did you read the entire article or read some of it then formed an opinion, assumed you knew where it was going, and then responded? The article I cited for the previous commenter was to point out that deuterium can be separated out using electrolysis. Think you may have missed the intent.
