For the previous four years, I had been living an area an-hour-and-a-half away, so my father and I began our journey at 3.30am.

We arrived in Taybat al-Imam at five am. I told soldiers at the regime checkpoint that I was coming to visit my sister, who had not left the town despite everything that had happened.

By six am, I had arrived in my sister’s neighbourhood. I saw the destruction caused by the regime and the Russian air force, with houses and mosques in ruins.

But in the middle of the ruined streets, I saw children playing together joyfully and fearlessly. There were five of them, including my 12-year-old nephew Hassan and Mohammed, 13.

When I saw them I cried tears of joy, I hugged and smelled and kissed all of them. I hadn’t seen them for four years. A whole generation is growing up during this war. I was afraid that we would have forgotten what the others looked like after all these years, but we hadn’t.

By seven in the morning, I was sitting with my father, my sister’s family and her neighbours in the sun, while the shouts and play of the children filled the neighbourhood with love and joy, just as if everything was normal.
