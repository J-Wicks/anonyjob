Per Eater, the restaurant is called Magnolia Tables, which is exceedingly on brand with everything else in Magnolia Markets, their theme park/lifestyle emoporium in Waco that features a garden supply store, a bakery and a food truck park. The menu will be mostly breakfast, but will include Chip’s famous ham sandwich(???), which is likely just a piece of ham with too much mayo slapped on some soft bread and served with a bag of potato chips. I’m not mad at that as an option, just saying, that’s all!!
