Well, damn. That’s nearly 1,000 words on Boston’s draft-pick situation, and we haven’t mentioned the fact that the team just went to the Eastern Conference finals, and is the biggest prospective buyer of NBA star talent. By moving down in the draft, the Celtics not only add a future pick, they save about $1.4 million in cap space, and every bit will help in the tough act of reaching roughly $30.3 million needed for a run at Hayward or Griffin. There’s always the trade route, too.
