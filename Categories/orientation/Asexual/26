I’ve read just about a hundred academic papers over the year, and successfully used some of their insight to more convincingly articulate my feelings and opinions. Efforts to talk about things that really matter in society were often frustrated before in shitty arguments and really poorly informed debates. I’m sure everybody is familiar with something like this playing out in comments on political Facebook posts.
