My six sons were among the first to join the revolution. Each of them offered everything they could to make it succeed. In 2013, two years after the revolution began, my sons got involved in the armed struggle.

My eldest son Mohamed was married with two boys. He had built his house next door to mine so that he could stay close even after he got married. When I left my house, I often saw him on the balcony smiling at me and inviting me to drink tea.

Mohamed became a tank specialist because he had experience from his compulsory military service.

One day Mohamed was standing on his balcony, but didn’t invite me to drink tea as usual. He asked me to pray for his victory.

He told me that he was about to take part in a major battle in the town of Kfar Abida in Hama’s countryside. The town was controlled by the regime and the rebels sought to liberate it.

I gazed at Mohamed. It was as if a voice was telling me, “Take a good look at him because you will never see him again.”

Mohamed left the house, looking behind him and smiling at me, his wife and his children. He crossed the street and kept walking until we could no longer see him.

His son Samer came and asked me, “Will dad come back, as my mother told me? Or will he be martyred like some of his friends, as I heard him once say?”

I didn’t know what to tell him and just kept silent. Then he said, “Dad loves heaven”.

I waited all that day for news of Mohamed, until his friends came to tell us that he had been martyred.

I heard the words they said but I didn’t believe them.

I asked them in shock, “Where is he?”

They told me that he had been heroic in battle and that they would bring his body later.

Amid the weeping of Mohamed’s wife and children, Samer came to me and said, “Didn’t I tell you that dad loves heaven?”.

This made everyone cry even harder.
