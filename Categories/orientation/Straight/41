Hey there, am a 28 years old. I moved to New York from the Greater Boston Area in Massachusetts. 
When I am not coding I love being active outdoors. I recently developed a passion for endurance sports like running and triathlon. I also love to hang out with friends and watch concerts / live music. I am super excited to explore New York City. I know that this city has a ton to offer.

Fullstack Academy has been an incredible learning experience in so many ways. However, I am looking forward to taking a break from coding 10 - 12 hours a day.
