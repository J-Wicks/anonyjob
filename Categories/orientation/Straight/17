It's a little trickier with test prep in general. A couple things which might be helpful to include in your pitch for other tutors are specific success stories or the fact that we all use the same materials and techniques. It's probably good to keep in mind during the sales conversations that you're really selling the program/philosophy/approach we use to prepare students rather than the individual tutors themselves. I would also tell people sometimes that since I have a lot more administrative/business tasks to attend to during a typical day, tutor X actually works with more students than I do now (only when that's actually true, of course, as it typically was with Ben at least), so their tutoring skills might be a little sharper than mine.
