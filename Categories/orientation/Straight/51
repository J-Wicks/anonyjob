This whole thing sticks with us - with women who have been sexually assaulted. Maybe if it was just once or twice, it would be enough to overlook. But every time a woman who has been through what we’ve been through tries to seek justice, she is vilified and her rapist runs free.

It’s heartbreaking. I’m so proud of these women who reported their rapes and stood up for themselves. When I was raped as a teenager, I didn’t have the strength. I was going through so much as a result of the rape, I didn’t want to put myself on the public chopping block and let people tear me apart for being too drunk or wearing a “slutty” dress or whatever.

I regret it a lot now - a decade later - because I’m scared that maybe my rapist did the same to another girl.

But it was too much for me at the time and it was too much because of shit like this. Because we are never believed. Because we are vilified and because our stories are stomped on and ignored.
