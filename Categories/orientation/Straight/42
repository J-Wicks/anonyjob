This doesn’t surprise me, but I’m also glad to have my suspicions validated. Most people - 10/12 is clearly most - believe he’s guilty;those who don’t are just stubbornly refusing to see fact or reason.

I’m not sure why, but I’m hopeful that there will be charges that stick someday. Maybe I have to be hopeful to take anything positive out of this fucking mess.

Also, Jez legal eagles, help me out: I get that they were restricted from talking about the other women he assaulted, but...for the life of me I don’t know how you could keep it out of a jury’s head in this case. It’s not like a lesser-known criminal trial where one might not learn of other prior offenses until after the trial. I’m pretty sure everyone with a tv or internet connection knows that this douchecanoe had dozens who openly accused him. How does that work in practice? How do you “not admit” something that is common knowledge?
