It wasn’t a normal day for the people of Homs. On 18 April, 2011, the city seemed to witness a rebirth. Demonstrations against the regime took place in most neighbourhoods and walls were spray-painted with slogans saying, “We want freedom.”

But the next day, as usual, I went in the morning to my job in central Homs, where I was working as a radiographer in a medical centre overlooking the old clock square.

I learned that there would be a funeral procession for seven of the martyrs of the Bab al-Saba’a neighbourhood. They had died after regime forces fired live bullets at the demonstrations. I went along.

Pain and sadness were clear on people’s faces. The funeral procession was headed to the cemetery. Crowds streamed along, shouting, “La ilaha illallah, God loves martyrs.” Due to the dramatic scenes, life in the al-Hamidiya neighbourhood stood still.

I watched what was happening, hiding my emotions because alongside me stood a work colleague who I knew was a supporter of President Bashar al-Assad and his regime. She said about the martyrs, “I don’t grieve for them, this is their punishment because they ruined the country.”

I was afraid to say something to her, I felt I might slap her and reveal that I supported the revolution. That would mean prison.

So I went back to the radiography room and opened my Facebook account on my mobile phone. I found that a friend had contacted me to tell me about a sit-in in the square after the funeral.
