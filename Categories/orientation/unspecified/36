On June 18, I was in Toronto for the triennial congress of the International Confederation of Midwives, a non-governmental organization that represents approximately 300,000 midwives across 114 countries. On my way there, I had made a little joke to myself—that I was heading to a gathering of friendly women in sensible shoes. In retrospect this fleeting thought embarrasses me. In many parts of the world, a midwife is the only health care provider that a woman will ever encounter. Personal style does not enter into the equation. Associating midwives—even North American midwives—with a certain aesthetic or ideology is unimaginative and, more to the point, it’s a dismissive hand in the face of the urgent and often overlooked work of providing compassionate maternal care.
