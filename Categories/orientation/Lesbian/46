I stopped watching them after 1. I saw chip wearing a Blue Lives Matter bracelet in the show, and 2. I found out they go to a church that is specifically anti LGBT.

Instead I watch Nate & Jeremiah instead. Totally a feel good show. It’s a gay couple that help out homeowners that are in over their heads, and give them way more than the homeowners could ever afford. It’s as if Homes on Homes did a show on design rather than building.
