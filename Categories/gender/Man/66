And as far as (foreign) bad guys, I think I made it clear that the European powers, Ottoman Empire, US, KSA, and Russia/Soviet Union were all antithetical opponents to Syriaâ€™s development as a stable and independent nation. ISIS is super recent in the timeline of these events. And Iran has been their ally (as in the Iran-Iraq War, and as well, recently) but it is an uneasy/strategic alliance.
