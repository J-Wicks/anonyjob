I really don’t want to be as angry as I am at white America. I know that statement sounds prejudiced and divisive. But it’s honest and true. I’m mad. Which has made this a very difficult time to be a brown-skinned person who’s half-white. Some of the people I am angry with are my family. And I love them. Even if they voted for a white supremacist like Donald Trump.
Asked my family why they wanted to vote for a morally bankrupt Atlantic City casino mogul for president. Even asked them not to vote for Donald Trump for president. (I had to try.) They said in reply, “they just can’t stand that Hillary Clinton.” They said they know men talk like Trump did on that Billy Bush recording. Yes, it was atrocious language; but it didn’t disqualify him from the presidency. Not in their minds. Not against her. And these were women speaking about Trump.
