Fateh al-Mousa, a 40-year-old grain trader and farmer, says that a Qatari Red Crescent scheme is working wonders to boost the local wheat market after years of war had depleted it.

Their loans cover all production needs including seeds, fertilizers, sprays and other supplies. Farmers repay the loan at the end of the season in the form of part of their crop, and the Red Crescent also buys a certain amount of wheat for more than 10 per cent of the local market value.

“Any farmer can only dream that someone would give him all the agriculture tools he needs and that they then buy the crop at a higher price than the market price,” said al-Mousa. “Thanks to this project the grain market has regained its former glory and we have maintained the quality of Syrian wheat.”

He added, “I own 20 dunams of land and didn’t hesitate to go to the local council to get a project application.

The Qatari Red Crescent is now working with the Assistance Coordination Unit and the General Organisation for Seed Multiplication to help farmers during the 2016-2017 season in various Syrian provinces.

Ammar Mohammed, 42, is director of Saraqib’s branch of the General Organisation for Seed Multiplication.

“The seed multiplication project is being repeated in Syria for the third year in a row,” he said. “It aims to promote agriculture and ensure self-sufficiency in areas outside regime control, as well as help unemployed people find jobs.”

Mohammed continued, “The area of cultivated land in the 2015-2016 season was 2,340 hectares and total production was 9,360 tons of wheat. We are waiting for this season’s harvest this season and hope to outdo last year’s figures.”
