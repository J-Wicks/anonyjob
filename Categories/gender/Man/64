While the internet may be clutching its pearls, according to numerous studies and anecdotal examples, nonwhite doctors and nurses see this all the time. The Root spoke with 12 black medical professionals who all say they have encountered similar situations, some routinely.

One of the medical world’s open secrets is that patients routinely refuse treatment from nonwhite physicians and nurses. In 2013, Tonya Battle sued a Flint, Mich., hospital when a supervisor held a meeting to inform the hospital workers that parents of a child in the neonatal intensive care unit didn’t want black members of the staff caring for the newborn—even posting a note that read, “No African American nurse to take care of baby.”

In 2010, a federal appeals court found a nursing home in violation of the Civil Rights Act after it refused to hire a black woman because there were racist patients in the nursing home. In another federal lawsuit, three black employees of a Philadelphia hospital were prevented from treating a pregnant woman because her partner was a white supremacist.
