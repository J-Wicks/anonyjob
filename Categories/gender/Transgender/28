Now, I am not a gambler: by nature, and in my role as Lead Producer at Appster, I am an intrinsically risk-aware and calculating individual.
My number one concern is to ensure successful app launches for our clients.
But if I were to place a bet on which of my clients are the most likely to successfully launch on time, on budget, and with the best possible products then I would not look to those with the most cash or the least complex app — no, I would hedge my bet based on to the clients’ commitment to creating and ensuring the success of their MVPs.
