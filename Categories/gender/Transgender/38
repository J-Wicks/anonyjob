It’s in this universe that show creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch created their new Netflix show GLOW, a serious, fictionalized story about the women who became these ridiculous characters in the ring. Starring Alison Brie as Ruth, a struggling actress desperately looking to try out for complex roles for women, GLOW follows a ragtag group of actresses (whether soap stars or Van Halen video extras) and weirdos (one girl’s wrestling persona is simply: wolf) looking for a job who end up in the ring.
