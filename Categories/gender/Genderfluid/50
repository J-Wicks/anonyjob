Sometimes I really find it hard not to think that in sexual assault cases if an accused decides to plead not guilty and take the case to trial, they should be required to testify. None of this “no case to answer” bullshit. Your lawyer gets to cross-examine the complainant? That’s cool, the prosecution get to cross-examine you too.

“Person A said / Person B said” sexual assault cases are pretty much the only kind of trial where a finding of not guilty of the accused is basically a finding that no crime was even committed in the first place. In a trial for murder, robbery, arson, etc., it’s usually not in dispute that someone is actually dead, a convenience store was held up, a building was burned down; it’s whether the accused is the person who did it or whether it was a different set of circumstances that led to someone being stabbed to death, a store clerk having a gun held in their face until they opened the till, or a house was destroyed by fire. But in an “A said/B said” rape trial, a finding of not guilty for the accused is essentially a finding that a rape didn’t even occur at all and the complainant is confused at best, a deliberate liar at worst.

Obviously I’m aware that yes, this is kind of a “burn the legal system to the ground” stance here and wouldn’t work. But if in rape cases if the accused was required to testify and be cross-examined, or even - and this is an even more nuclear option - the burden of proof in rape cases lay on the defence instead of the prosecution, and everybody in the community knew this? I think there would be fewer rapes. Maybe not a whole heap less, but a few.
