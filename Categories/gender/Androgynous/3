I lacked the enthusiasm my then-boyfriend of three years had about our “first time” that was to occur once we were married. I couldn’t comprehend his excitement, but “waiting until marriage” was the only excuse I could come up with for having no sexual attraction to the guy I loved with my whole soul, that I could easily imagine marrying after college.
