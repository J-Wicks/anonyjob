The Senate bill also focuses on abortion coverage, targeting providers directly by placing more restrictions on federal subsidies, particularly Medicaid waivers (there are exceptions for rape and incest, as well as cases “where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death”). This is essentially a plan to defund Planned Parenthood. In addition, it restricts federal subsidies for being used on “any health plan that includes coverage for abortions” with, again, similar exceptions.
