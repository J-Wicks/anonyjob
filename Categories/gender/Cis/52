Any prosecutor that actually tries cases won’t be surprised by this at all. There’s a popular belief that everyone that goes to trial is found guilty but—in state court at least—this is nonsense (in federal court, the conviction rate at trial is insanely high). I’ve got anecdote upon anecdote of crazy jury verdicts where the evidence of guilt was overwhelming and the jury came back hung or NG. I had a domestic battery case where a juror called me crying a week after a not guilty verdict. She told me that they didn’t know a hung jury was allowed. The jury told the judge they couldn’t agree (one juror was steadfastly not guilty) and the judge told them to continue deliberating. Eleven guilty voters switched to not guilty because they thought they had to agree and the eleven gave up trying to convince the holdout.

Jury selection is a crapshoot. Anyone that says they can pick out the crazy person, the person with a grudge, the sovereign citizen, etc. is lying to you. I’ve talked to a lot of jurors after trial, and the only conclusion I can draw is that it’s more likely than not that every jury will include one or two idiots. And, to be fair, sometimes I’ve benefited from their ignorance. I’ve had jurors tell me that they found a defendant guilty based on the most irrelevant piece of evidence introduced at trial.

But, at the end of the day, it’s better than any other system.
