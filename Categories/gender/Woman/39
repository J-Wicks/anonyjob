Aside from his leading role in the future best movie of 2018, Black Panther, Boseman is never not playing a historical figure—Jackie Robinson (in 42), James Brown (Get On Up), and now he’s America’s first black Supreme Court Justice. Here, Boseman depicts Marshall as something of a superhero attorney, one who served as an NAACP lawyer and won the pivotal Brown v Board of Education case, and who says lines like, “The only way to get through a bigot’s door is to break it down.”
