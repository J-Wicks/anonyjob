Even the most neutral emails sound menacing, unhinged, or inappropriately friendly in almost any font other than the default one. Since this is a guideline and not a rule, there is some wiggle room. People who run bead stores, pet trainers or groomers, and teachers who work with children in grades three or below can use a “wacky” font when writing in their professional capacity, but only if the email contains good or routine news such as a reminder that Wednesday is room four’s summer solstice celebration, or that dog Halloween costumes are 30% off through Friday.
